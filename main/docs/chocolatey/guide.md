# What is Chocolatey?

[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) is an package manager for Windows and a software management automation tool.

# Why Chocolatey?

How many times do you hear about an awesome tool/application from your friends and want to try it out? How much effort do you go through to set a tool and all of its requirements up on your machine?Do you realize that all of this manual effort is a pain? It's a pain we are used to! It's something we just do and don't realize we are wasting time doing all of this manual process.And worse, when we install applications it's always... Next Next Next Finish.

There is a better way! Once you start to use Chocolatey to silently install applications, tools, and to quickly set up things on your machine, you will start to realize that it is more of **a global automation tool**

# How to install
