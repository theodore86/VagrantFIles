# Virtual Machine for test automation

This part of the site documents the *Vagrant testing environment*. It is split in two major parts:

- User guide
- Developer guide

If youâ€™re just getting started, it is highly recommended that you first read the [Quick Guide](https://gitlab.lab.sk.alcatel-lucent.com/e2e/vagrant-e2e/blob/master/README.md) in order to start setting up the testing virtual machine.

If anything is unclear in these docs, please let us know by filing [an issue](https://gitlab.lab.sk.alcatel-lucent.com/e2e/vagrant-e2e/issues).
